## My process
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced writing semantically correct webapps and better structuring the CSS rules. I've also learned to not rush, and really think about the program structure before actually coding.
I learned how to use the HTML5 Drag and Drop API, although  it doesn't seem to work properly across different browsers and devices.

### Continued development

I'll learn more about different implementations of the drag and drop functionality, and the different libraries that already exist.
